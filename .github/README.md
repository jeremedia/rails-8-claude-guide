  -f update_docs=true
```

## üîë Required Setup

### 1. Add Repository Secret

Go to **Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions** and add:

- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`: Your Anthropic API key from [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com)

### 2. Verify Permissions

Ensure workflows have these permissions (already configured in workflows):
- `contents: write` - To update documentation
- `issues: write` - To comment on issue #2
- `pull-requests: write` - For PR interactions

## üìä Monitoring

### View Workflow Runs

```bash
# List all workflow runs
gh run list

# List runs for specific workflow
gh run list --workflow=rails-daily-research.yml

# View specific run details
gh run view <run-id>

# Watch a run in progress
gh run watch
```

### Check Latest Research

- View [Issue #2](../../../issues/2) for all research comments
- Check [Actions tab](../../../actions) for workflow history
- Review commit history for documentation updates

## ‚öôÔ∏è Customization

### Change Schedule

Edit the cron expression in `rails-daily-research.yml`:

```yaml
on:
  schedule:
    # Examples:
    - cron: '0 9 * * *'    # Daily at 9 AM UTC
    - cron: '0 */6 * * *'  # Every 6 hours
    - cron: '0 9 * * 1'    # Weekly on Monday
```

### Modify Research Focus

Edit the prompt in any workflow to change what Rails topics to prioritize:

```yaml
prompt: |
  Focus especially on:
  - Rails 8.1 Beta updates
  - Active Storage changes
  - Turbo and Stimulus updates
```

### Change Claude Model

Update the `claude_args` in any workflow:

```yaml
claude_args: |
  --max-turns 15
  --model claude-opus-4-1-20250805  # Use Opus for more thorough research
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Workflow Not Running

1. Check if Actions are enabled: Settings ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí General
2. Verify `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set in secrets
3. Check workflow syntax: `gh workflow view <workflow-name>`

### Claude Not Responding

1. Ensure `@claude` is used (not `/claude` or `@Claude`)
2. Check API key is valid
3. Review [workflow runs](../../../actions) for error messages

### No Documentation Updates

1. Workflow may determine no updates needed
2. Check issue #2 for "No updates found" comments
3. Manually trigger with specific focus area

## üìà Cost Tracking

Each workflow run uses the Anthropic API. Typical costs:
- Daily research: ~$0.05-0.15 per run
- Manual research: ~$0.10-0.25 per run
- Claude mentions: ~$0.02-0.10 per response

Monthly estimate (daily runs): ~$3-5

## üîí Security Notes

- API keys are stored as encrypted secrets
- Workflows run in isolated GitHub-hosted runners
- No sensitive data is logged or exposed
- All changes are tracked in git history
